# Feature Specification: Apple Product Stock Checker

**Feature Branch**: `001-apple-slack-github`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "As a project, I want to check the stock for in-store pickup of Apple products, format the results clearly, and post them to Slack. It should run periodically (every 5 minutes) with GitHub Actions, and post to Slack only if there is a difference from the previous result. I want to create it as a Python script. I want to build the cloud infrastructure within the free tier. A database is not particularly necessary. If I were to use one, a file-based one like SQLite would be good."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to automatically monitor the in-store pickup availability of specific Apple products and receive a Slack notification only when the stock status changes, so that I can be promptly informed about availability without constant manual checking.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** the stock status of a monitored product has changed since the last check, **When** the scheduled job runs, **Then** a formatted notification is sent to the designated Slack channel.
2.  **Given** the stock status of all monitored products remains unchanged, **When** the scheduled job runs, **Then** no notification is sent to Slack.
3.  **Given** a check fails due to a persistent network error or an API change, **When** the system retries the check 3 times with exponential backoff and still fails, **Then** an error is logged and a failure notification is sent to the designated Slack channel.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the Apple product page structure changes?
- How does the system handle initial setup when there is no previous result to compare against?
- What is the behavior if the Slack webhook is invalid or the service is down?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST check for in-store pickup stock of specified Apple products at specified retail stores.
- **FR-002**: The check MUST be executed periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) by a scheduled job runner like GitHub Actions.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST persist the most recent stock status to compare against the next check's results.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST send a notification to a configured Slack channel **only if** the stock status has changed.
- **FR-005**: The Slack notification message MUST be clearly formatted, indicating the product, store, and availability.
- **FR-006**: The core logic MUST be implemented as a Python script.
- **FR-007**: Any cloud infrastructure used MUST operate within a free tier.
- **FR-008**: The system SHOULD NOT require a persistent database. If storage is needed for state, a file-based solution (e.g., SQLite, JSON file) is acceptable.
- **FR-009**: The target products and stores MUST be configurable via environment variables (e.g., GitHub Secrets) without changing the source code.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Product**: Represents an Apple product to be monitored (e.g., iPhone 16 Pro, Blue, 256GB).
- **Store**: Represents an Apple retail store to check for stock (e.g., Apple Shibuya).
- **StockState**: Represents the availability status of a Product at a Store at a specific point in time.
